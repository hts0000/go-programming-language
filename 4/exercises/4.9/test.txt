The Hero in My Heart
As we know, most peoplehave heroes in their hearts. For me, Dr Norman Bethune is the hero in my heart.He was a great doctor from Canada.
Dr Bethune was good at performing operations.And taking photos was his hobby. In 1938, he came toChina.
He opened hospitals and invented medical tools. He worked so hard thathe saved thousands of Chinese people. He didn’t stop totake care of his own injured hand and died.
I am deeply moved by his stories. So I’ll work hard today and do my best to helpothers.
